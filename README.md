This site will be a simple site containing a home page and linking 
to a few other pages each containing a different recipe.

the skills i will need are:
- knowing how to make a basic HTML template
- knowing how to link the pages together using href
- knowing how to list the recipes down properly in an orderly fashion
- and knowing how to add different images of the results into each page.
