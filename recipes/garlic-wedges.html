        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Potato wedges are a classic side dish and this baked spicy garlic version is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. Perfect for busy weeknights or casual entertaining.</p>
            <p>
                Potato wedges are the king of all simple side dishes in my opinion. 
                Not only are they a guaranteed hit every time I make them, they’re also easy and quite versatile. 
                I love using garlic powder, chilli flakes and herbs to season potato wedges but any herbs and spices will work.
                Baked wedges are the perfect side dish for burgers, sandwiches, roast and grilled meat and chicken. 
                They’re also a pretty perfect easy snack recipe served with ketchup and makes a great lunch when you don’t have much in the house. 
                What I love so much about wedges is that I kind of get the satisfaction of eating fries with none of the guilt. 
                Ok, who am I kidding, I feel no guilt when eating fries BUT wedges are definitely a little healthier.. I also always leave the skins 
                on because I seriously love their flavour (and of course, all those nutrients) but if you prefer, feel free to peel the potatoes first.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-heat the oven to 200ºC/390°F.</li>
                <li>Place the potato wedges in a large bowl and add the oil, spices and seasonings.</li>
                <li>Mix well, ensuring each potato wedge is covered with the herbs and spices.</li>

                <li>Bake for 45 minutes - 1 hour until the potatoes are cooked through and crispy on the outside. Flip halfway into the cooking time to ensure even browning.</li>
