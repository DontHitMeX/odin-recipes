        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The cheesiest chicken lasagna layered with cheddar and mozzarella cheese, rich chicken bolognese and no-boil lasagna sheets is a dinner favorite.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Lasagna is pretty much always guaranteed to impress. There are very few people who can resist all that cheesy, meaty goodness. 
            And even though a classic lasagna is a thing of beauty, this chicken lasagna recipe has been my go-to for a while now.
            Not only is it ever so slightly lighter because the chicken doesn’t add much in terms of fat or rich, beefy flavor, I also find it much 
            quicker to make because the bolognese doesn’t need to cook for very long. To make the assembly go even faster, I often buy cheese 
            sauce and use that instead of making my own. Layering the lasagna with grated cheddar and mozzarella adds all the melty goodness you want 
            when you’re eating a plate of comforting lasagna.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Chicken bolognese:</strong> Brown ground chicken (chicken mince) over high heat. Remove the</p>
                <p>chicken and set aside while you saute onion, celery, carrots and mushrooms until they</p>
                <p>start to soften. You can add spinach too if you wanted to boost the veggies in the recipe.</p>
                <p>Add garlic and herbs and add the chicken back into the pot. Cook for another minute</p>
                <p>then pour in tomatoes, stock, Balsamic vinegar and sugar. Reduce the heat and allow to</p>
                <p>simmer for 10 minutes until the sauce has reduced slightly. Season to taste.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Make the bechamel sauce:</strong> I know a lot of people like using ricotta cheese in lasagna but</p>
                <p>I think bechamel sauce makes it so much creamier. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Whisk</p>
                <p>in the flour then cook for 1-2 minutes until the roux turns a very light golden brown.</p>
                <p>Whisk in the milk, a little at a time, until the sauce is smooth and the milk has been</p>
                <p>incorporated. Reduce the heat and allow to simmer gently, stirring regularly, until the</p>
                <p>sauce is smooth and thick. Add the cayenne pepper, nutmeg, mustard powder and</p>
                <p>cheese (if using) and stir in. Season to taste.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Assembly:</strong> Layer the bolognese mixture with no-cook lasagna sheets and</p>
                <p>bechamel/cheese sauce in an oven-proof baking dish (18cm x 25cm or 7in x 10in). Add</p>
                <p>a quarter cup mozzarella cheese with each layer to make it ultra cheese. Top with</p>
                <p>cheddar cheese, mozzarella and the half cup parmesan cheese.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the dish with foil and bake at 200ºC/390ºF for 30 minute or until a knife can</p>
                <p>easily be inserted. Remove the foil and bake until golden brown on top. Remove from</p>
                <p>the oven and allow to rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
