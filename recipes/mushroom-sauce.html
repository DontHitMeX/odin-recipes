       <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Every cook needs a good easy creamy mushroom sauce recipe. It’s perfect stirred through pasta and fantastic on grilled steak.</p>
            <p>When I was 14 years old I asked my mom if I could start cooking dinner for our family every now and then. 
                She didn’t hesitate for a second to let me take the reigns while she went to settle on the couch with her book. 
                I didn’t have a clue what to make but luckily my mom kept a pretty well-stocked fridge/freezer and I quickly settled 
                on chicken schnitzel (which I still buy ready-made, FYI) drenched in creamy mushroom sauce, mashed potatoes and carrots.</p>
            <p>There was only one problem, I had no idea how to make mushroom sauce. My mom gave me direction from the couch but for 
                the most part I was on my own. I chopped the garlic, sliced the mushrooms and added them to a hot pan with some oil. 
                Fried them (for not nearly long enough) and poured in WAY too much cream. In went a slurry of milk and corn flour 
                to thicken it all up and I seasoned it (again, not nearly enough). It was the first recipe I had ever made by myself.</p>
            <p>Feel free to play around with the flavorings but I honestly think thyme, garlic and lemon were all made 
                for mushrooms. If you wanted to keep the sauce more on the low-cal side, substitute the cream for milk. Of course, the sauce won’t 
                be as rich and luscious but it will still be delicious. And that’s really it. This recipe is SO easy and so simple but will quickly 
                become a favorite in your home too. Guaranteed.</p>
